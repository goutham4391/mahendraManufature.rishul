<p><p>Every time the society needed us, we stepped in and helped create a new industry. In 1945, our journey commenced with us getting into the steel business, and over time, we expanded to 22 key industries. A need for change in the agricultural practices pushed us to foray into that sector right before the agriculture revolution began in India. We became one of the key torch-bearers of the IT revolution in our country. Our focus now lies in developing alternate energy sources because we believe energy conservation will play a huge role in ensuring a better future &ndash; for not just our country and communities, but the entire world.</p></p><a class="know-more-link" title="" target="_self" href="mahindra-services-and-businesses.html" onclick="window.dataLayer.push({'event': 'know_more'});">Know more <i class="fa fa-caret-right" aria-hidden="true"></i></a></div>
